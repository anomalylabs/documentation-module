## Utilities

### documentation:sync

You can use the `documentation:sync` command to sync all versions of all projects.

```bash
php artisan documentation:sync
```

Optionally you can sync all versions of a single project by providing the project `slug`:

```bash
php artisan documentation:sync my-project
```

You can also sync a specific version for a specific project by appending the version to sync to your command as well:

```bash
php artisan documentation:sync my-project v1.0
```

Lastly, you can specify a specific page to sync by specifying the page's natural path (as seen in it's URL):

```bash
php artisan documentation:sync my-project v1.0 prologue/change-log
```
